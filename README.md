# NC News

This is the frontend website for NC News, a project showcasing the skills I have developed during my time on the Northcoders bootcamp.

The completed backend component of this project, which serves the articles, comments and metadata displayed on the site, can be found [here](https://github.com/N1ck-Benson/be-nc-news). The hosted backend API is [here](https://nc-news-database.herokuapp.com/api), and is where you can find all the available endpoints for the project.

Below is a brief outline of how to run the frontend code contained in this repo. It's a work in progress, but I'm proud of the skills I've developed and am ambitious to add new styling and functionality!

## Cloning the repo and running the code

In order to run the source code in this repo yourself, you'll first need to clone the repo.

You'll also need to have the following dependencies installed:

    Node.js
    React
    Knex
    Express

The minimum version of node.js required for the code to run is 15.2.0. The other dependencies and their versions are included in the package.json, so you should be able to install them by entering running npm install in your terminal.

You will also need a file called knexfile.js. To create this file, you can run knex init in the terminal. The knexfile should look like this:

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
